# 3d-viewer-demo

A very minimal 3d viewer using THREE.js

### To run a local copy

1. Run a webserver in the `3d-viewer-demo` directory with your favorite http server (e.g., `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`)
4. Browse to http://localhost:8000 or whatever other port you chose at step 1.

### Notes

* The current mouse interation UI is clunky and is more or less inherited from github.com/kartta-labs/kscope, which
  I copied most of this code from.  To use it, drag the mouse to turn your head, and use W A S D keys to move around.
